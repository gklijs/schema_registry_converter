This library provides a way of using
the [Confluent Schema Registry](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/index.html) in a way that is
compliant with the Java client. Since
[Karapace](https://github.com/aiven/karapace/blob/master/README.rst) is API compatible it could also be used with this
library. The release notes can be found
on [github](https://github.com/gklijs/schema_registry_converter/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md)
Consuming/decoding and producing/encoding is supported. It's also possible to provide the schema to use when decoding.
You can also include references when decoding. Without a schema provided, the latest schema with the same `subject` will
be used.

It's supposed to be feature complete compared to the Java version. If anything is missing or not working as expected
please create an issue or start a discussion
on [github discussions](https://github.com/gklijs/schema_registry_converter/discussions). An example of using this
library async with protobuf to produce data to Kafka can be found
in [ksqlDB-GraphQL-poc](https://github.com/gklijs/ksqlDB-GraphQL-poc/tree/main/rust-data-creator). A blog with a bit of
background on this library can be found
titled [confluent Schema Registry and Rust](https://blog.openweb.nl/blog/confluent-schema-registry-and-rust)

## Getting Started

[schema_registry_converter.rs is available on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/schema_registry_converter). It is
recommended to look there for the newest and more elaborate documentation. It has a couple of feature flags, be sure to
set them correctly.

To use it to convert using avro async use:

```toml
[dependencies]
schema_registry_converter = { version = "4.0.0", features = ["avro"] }
```

For simplicity there are `easy` variants that internally have an arc.
Making it easier to use at the price of some overhead. To use the `easy` variants add the `easy` feature and use the
structs that start with `Easy` in the name to do the conversions.

```toml
[dependencies]
schema_registry_converter = { version = "4.0.0", features = ["easy", "avro"] }
```

...and see the [docs](https://docs.rs/schema_registry_converter) for how to use it.

All the converters also have a blocking (non async) version, in that case use something like:

```toml
[dependencies]
schema_registry_converter = { version = "4.0.0", default-features = false, features = ["avro", "blocking"] }
```

If you need to use both in a project you can use something like, but have to be weary you import the correct paths
depending on your use.

```toml
[dependencies]
schema_registry_converter = { version = "4.0.0", features = ["avro", "blocking"] }
```

## Consumer

For consuming messages encoded with the schema registry, you need to fetch the correct schema from the schema registry
to transform it into a record. For clarity, error handling is omitted from the diagram.

![Consumer activity flow](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gklijs/schema_registry_converter/master/uml/consumer.puml)

## Producer

For producing messages which can be properly consumed by other clients, the proper id needs to be encoded with the
message. To get the correct id, it might be necessary to register a new schema. For clarity, error handling is omitted
from the diagram.

![Producer activity flow](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?cache=no&src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gklijs/schema_registry_converter/master/uml/producer.puml)

## Example with consumer and producer using Avro (blocking)

Examples which does both consuming/decoding and producing/encoding. To use structs with Avro they must have an
implementation
of either the `serde::Deserialize` or `serde::Serialize` trait to work. The examples are especially useful to update
from the 1.x.x version, when starting you probably want to use the async versions.

```rust
use rdkafka::message::{Message, BorrowedMessage};
use apache_avro::types::Value;
use schema_registry_converter::blocking::{Decoder, Encoder};
use schema_registry_converter::blocking::schema_registry::SubjectNameStrategy;

fn main() {
    let decoder = Decoder::new(SrSettings::new(String::from("http://localhost:8081")));
    let encoder = Encoder::new(SrSettings::new(String::from("http://localhost:8081")));
    let hb = get_heartbeat(msg, &decoder);
    let record = get_future_record_from_struct("hb", Some("id"), hb, &encoder);
    producer.send(record);
}

fn get_value<'a>(
    msg: &'a BorrowedMessage,
    decoder: &'a Decoder,
) -> Value {
    match decoder.decode(msg.payload()) {
        Ok(v) => v,
        Err(e) => panic!("Error getting value: {}", e),
    }
}

fn get_heartbeat<'a>(
    msg: &'a BorrowedMessage,
    decoder: &'a Decoder,
) -> Heartbeat {
    match decoder.decode_with_name(msg.payload()) {
        Ok((name, value)) => {
            match name.name.as_str() {
                "Heartbeat" => {
                    match name.namespace {
                        Some(namespace) => {
                            match namespace.as_str() {
                                "nl.openweb.data" => from_value::<Heartbeat>(&value).unwrap(),
                                ns => panic!("Unexpected namespace {}", ns),
                            }
                        }
                        None => panic!("No namespace in schema, while expected"),
                    }
                }
                name => panic!("Unexpected name {}", name),
            }
        }
        Err(e) => panic!("error getting heartbeat: {}", e),
    }
}

fn get_future_record<'a>(
    topic: &'a str,
    key: Option<&'a str>,
    values: Vec<(&'static str, Value)>,
    encoder: &'a Encoder,
) -> FutureRecord<'a> {
    let subject_name_strategy = SubjectNameStrategy::TopicNameStrategy(topic, false);
    let payload = match encoder.encode(values, &subject_name_strategy) {
        Ok(v) => v,
        Err(e) => panic!("Error getting payload: {}", e),
    };
    FutureRecord {
        topic,
        partition: None,
        payload: Some(&payload),
        key,
        timestamp: None,
        headers: None,
    }
}

fn get_future_record_from_struct<'a>(
    topic: &'a str,
    key: Option<&'a str>,
    heartbeat: Heartbeat,
    encoder: &'a Encoder,
) -> FutureRecord<'a> {
    let subject_name_strategy = SubjectNameStrategy::TopicNameStrategy(topic, false);
    let payload = match encoder.encode_struct(heartbeat, &subject_name_strategy) {
        Ok(v) => v,
        Err(e) => panic!("Error getting payload: {}", e),
    };
    FutureRecord {
        topic,
        partition: None,
        payload: Some(&payload),
        key,
        timestamp: None,
        headers: None,
    }
}
```

## Direct interaction with schema registry

Some functions have been opened so this library can be used to directly get all the subjects, all the version of a
subject, or the raw schema with a subject and version. For these see the
either [async](tests/async_impl/schema_registry_calls.rs) or [blocking](tests/blocking/schema_registry_calls.rs) version
of the integration tests.

## Example using to post schema to schema registry

```rust
use schema_registry_converter::blocking::schema_registry::{
    post_schema,
    SuppliedSchema
};

fn main() {
    let schema = SuppliedSchema {
        name: String::from("nl.openweb.data.Heartbeat"),
        schema_type: SchemaType::AVRO,
        schema: String::from(r#"{"type":"record","name":"Heartbeat","namespace":"nl.openweb.data","fields":[{"name":"beat","type":"long"}]}"#),
        references: vec![],
    };
    let result = post_schema("http://localhost:8081/subjects/test-value/versions", heartbeat_schema);
}
```

## Relation to related libraries

The avro part of the conversion is handled by avro-rs. As such, I don't include tests for every possible schema. While I
used rdkafka in combination to successfully consume from and produce to kafka, and while it's used in the example, this
crate has no direct dependency on it. All this crate does is convert [u8] <-> Some Value (based on converter used). With
Json and Protobuf some other dependencies are pulled in, by using said features. I have tried to encapsulate all the
errors in the SRCError type. So even when you get a pannic/error that's an SRCError it could be an error from one of the
dependencies. Please make sure you are using the library correctly, and the error is not caused by a depency, before
creating an issue.

## Integration test

The integration tests require a Kafka cluster running on the default ports. It will create topics, register schema's,
produce and consume some messages. They are only included when compiled with the `kafka_test` feature, so to include
them in testing `cargo test --verbose --all-features -- --test-threads=1` needs to be run.
The 'prepare_integration_test.sh' script can be used to create the 3 topics needed for the tests. To ensure Java
compatibility it's also needed to run
the [schema-registry-test-app](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gklijs/schema-registry-test-app) docker image.
