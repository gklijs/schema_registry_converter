## Release notes

### 2.0.0

This release has a breaking change in the SubjectNameStrategy where the supplied schema now is in a Box, to keep the size of the Enum smaller.
Another breaking change is that the protocol  (http or https) needs  to be included in the schema registry url.

-TODO- I hope to also add support for authentication for Confluent Cloud and Protobuf for this version.

### 1.1.0

This release makes it easier to work with structs, instead of the raw Value type in a vector.
To use structs with avro you need to add `#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]` above your
struct and also have a dependency on serde with the derive feature enabled. like:
```toml
[dependencies.serde]
version = "1.0"
features = ["derive"]
```

#### Issues

- Added support for the decoder to also get the name of the schema, this
can be used to determine witch crate to use the values for. In the [tests](https://github.com/gklijs/schema_registry_converter/blob/master/src/lib.rs#L577)
there is an example.
- Added support the the encoder to take a struct. To do this use the `encode_struct`
instead of the `encode` function on the encoder.

### 1.0.0

#### Issues

- Made it easier to use the crate by changing some values to owed strings.
- Fixed to issues related to sending the schema to the schema registry.
- Added integration tests, to test against a kafka cluster.
- Make post_schema public so it can be used directly.
